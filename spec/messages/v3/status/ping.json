    "description": "Ping acts a watchdog between the client and the server. The server will expect the client to send a ping message at a certain interval (interval will be sent to the client as part of the identification step). If the client fails to ping within the specified time, the server will disconnect and stop all currently connected devices.\n\nThis will handle cases like the client crashing without a proper disconnect. This is not a guaranteed global failsafe, since it will not guard against problems like a client UI thread locking up while a client communication thread continues to work.",
